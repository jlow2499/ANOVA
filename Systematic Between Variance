The systematic between groups variance
100 XP
To understand everything a little better, you will calculate the F-ratio of a repeated measures 
design by yourself in the next exercises. 
First you will need the systematic between groups variance. This one is the same as in the 
between groups design: the variance due to grouping by conditions. Therefore, this should be 
nothing new, but it does not hurt to refresh your memory.
Recall that the formula for systematic sum of squares is 
SSA=n∑(Yj−YT)2

where Yj are the group means, YT is the grand mean and n is the number of items in each group 

with j the number of groups.
The formula for systematic variance is then 
MSA=SSAdfA
where df stands for the degrees of freedom which are set equal to the number of groups minus 

one.
You will keep working with the working memory example, the data wm is still loaded in your 
workspace.
Instructions
•	Define the number of subjects n for each condition.
•	Calculate the group means of IQ scores IQ by condition using the tapply() function. 
The tapply() function is used to group the observations for IQ by the variable cond. 
Subsequently, the function may calculate the mean of each group. The first argument 
should contain the data of which you want to calculate the means and the second 
argument should contain the data that you need to sort the different groups.
•	You also need the grand mean y_t, so calculate this. Use the R function mean().
•	Now you have all the ingredients to calculate the between groups sum of squares 
ss_cond by applying the first formula.
•	Finally you can calculate the systematic variance ms_cond using the second formula. Of 
course you need to define the degrees of freedom df first .
