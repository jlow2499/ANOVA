Bonferroni adjusted p-values
100 XP
Just like Tukey's procedure, the Bonferroni correction is a method that is used to counteract the 
problem of inflated type I errors while engaging in multiple pairwise comparisons between 
subgroups. Bonferroni is generally known as the most conservative method to control the 
familywise error rate. 
Bonferroni is based on the idea that if you test N dependent or independent hypotheses, one way 
of maintaining the familywise error rate is to test each individual hypothesis at a statistical 
significance level that is deflated by a factor 1n. So, for a significance level for the whole family 
of tests of α, the Bonferroni correction would be to test each of the individual tests at a 
significance level of alphan.
Instructions
•	Suppose you have a p-value of 0.005 and there are eight pairwise comparisons. Use the 
p.adjust() function while applying the Bonferroni method to calculate the adjusted p-
values. Assign the result to bonferroni_ex. Print the variable out in order to see how 
much the p-values are deflated to correct for the inflated type I errors of doing a multiple 
pairwise hypothesis test.
•	Make use of the pairwise.t.test() function to test the pairwise comparisons 
between your different conditions and include the Bonferroni correction in one single 
command. Do not forget to setting the p.adjust argument in the pairwise.t.test() 
function to "bonferroni".
