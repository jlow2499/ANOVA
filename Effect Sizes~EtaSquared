The effect sizes
100 XP
In the previous exercises you discovered that both simple effects are significant, so why is there 
an interaction effect? 
The definition of an interaction effect states that the effect of one variable changes across levels 
of the other variable. For example, in a difficult driving condition case you might expect an 
effect of the conversation variable, but for an easy driving condition not. 
Unfortunately, it is not that simple. In order to really understand the effect sizes, you should 
make use of the etaSquared() function in R: etaSquared(anova_object, anova=T)
Instructions
•	Calculate η2 for the easy driving condition with the help of etaSquared() and print the 
result to the console.
•	Calculate η2 for the difficult driving condition with the help of etaSquared() and print 
the result to the console.
